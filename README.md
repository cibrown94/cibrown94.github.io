This project was the first project, I have ever done. I look back on the Treasure Hunt, as use it is a reminder of how far I came as a Full Stack Software Developer.

Treasure Hunt was partner project, I worked with a LEARN Academy Hotel Cohort member named Molly. We used HTML, CSS, and some Javascript code. That was my first time using Javascript. 
This project was done during the LEARN Academy's Jumpstart Weekend Session at the end of October 2022. Very eye opening. 

In the creating Treasure Hunt, it was my first time using GitHub, VS Code, and the console log. My partner and I slowly navigated into what the project is now, celebrating our code functalitiy, with a 15 minute break.
I had envirnonmental blockers. My environmental blockers were finding someplace in my home that provided a steady and quiet workspace, and someplace that provides egonomics.
Eventually, I settled on the floor of my living room. 

I enjoyed making this project, very humbling experience to look back on. 

My hope for the project is that when my partner and I are graduated from the LEARN Academy, that we can work on and deploy the project together with our new skillset.
